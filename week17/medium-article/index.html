        The person leading the U.S. response to the
        <a href="">coronavirus outbreak</a>, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S.
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her
        family for a possible pandemic that could cause “severe” disruption to
        everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close,
        and social gatherings are discouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning,”
        Messonnier said today in a conference call with reporters. “And I told
        my children that while I didn't think that they were at risk right now,
        we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption to our
        lives.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Messonnier, who directs the CDC's National Center for Immunization and
        Respiratory Diseases, sounded the most concerning tone yet that
        COVID-19, as the disease is called, will likely become a pandemic. “The
        fact that this virus has caused illness and death, along with sustained
        person-to-person spread is concerning,” she said. It meets two of the
        criteria for a pandemic. Meanwhile, she said, “the world moves closer to
        meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.”
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that
        their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that
        appear without a known source of exposure — are now occurring in Hong
        Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.
