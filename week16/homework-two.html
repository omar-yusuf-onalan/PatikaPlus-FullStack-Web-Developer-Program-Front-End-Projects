    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Omar Yusuf Onalan. While I am currently in Istanbul because of
      university, I normally live in Eskisehir. I enjoy reading various kinds of
      books ranging from philosophy to genres like fantasy and sci-fi. Another
      type of media I enjoy is TV series of which my favorite is the Sherlock TV
      series. I am interested in Web Development. Thanks to the training of
      <a href="https://www.kodluyoruz.org" target="blank"> Kodluyoruz</a>, I
      have learned a plethora of different things related to Web Development.

    <p>
      Sherlock is a British mystery crime drama television series based on Sir
      Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Created by Steven
      Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes
      and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.
    </p>
    <p>
      One aspect I am appreciative of is how the producers have stayed loyal to
      the weird friendship between Holmes and Watson we witness in the source
      material.
